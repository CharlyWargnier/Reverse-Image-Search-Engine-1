# Reverse-Image-Search-Engine 
**A picture is worth a thousand words**

## Introduction
Reverse Image Search also known as Content based Image retrevial, This is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem, that is, the problem of searching for images in large databases.

## Data
To build search engine we need massive amount of data to seach on. For this image search engine I used [Caltech101](https://data.caltech.edu/records/20086) dataset.

This dataset contains 101 classes and there are about 40 to 800 images per category.
